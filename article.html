				In this module, we have studied how to analyze continuous time signals \(x(t)\). Among techniques to analyze these signals are the Fourier Series, Fourier Transform, and the Laplace transform. All these three methods transform a signal from the time-domain to another domain. Comment briefly on the following:
				<ul>
					<li>What are the differences among these methods? (e.g.: type of signal \(x(t)\), nature of the transformed domain, etc.)</li>
					<li> "All these methods are different ways to scan \(x(t)\), and decompose it into frequencies." Explain why you agree/disagree. Are there any other similar aspects among these transforms?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="para">
			The assignment went on to specify that there is no "perfect answer" for the questions posed, and I believe was mostly meant to get us to explore the different transforms in more detail and get a "feel" for them. I definitely enjoyed the exercise and learned a lot from it.
			I am publishing this article here on the suggestion of the instructor who graded my submission.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<div class="para">
			Signals and systems are very common in nature. Many physical quantities that we encounter everyday in nature can be viewed as signals, and many natural phenomena can be viewed as processes or systems, that respond to such signals, by generating new signals. This ubiquity of signals and systems has motivated the development of general tools to represent and analyze them methodically and conveniently.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			In the context of systems, we are often interested in
			<ul>
				<li>identifying "nice" systems with "nice" properties, and,</li>
				<li>a general method to find the responses of such systems to any given signal.</li>
			</ul>
			A class of systems that has such properties is that of linear, and time-invariant, or LTI systems. Such systems have the property of responding to a linear combination of input signals with the same linear combination of the corresponding output signals, greatly simplifying their analysis. Fortunately, a large number of real world systems belong to this class, and throughout this article, we will limit our discussion to such systems only.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			In the context of signals, we are interested in
			<ul>
				<li>finding signals that are "simple" or "fundamental",</li>
				<li>representing more "complex" signals in terms of such "simple" or "fundamental" signals, or "decompose" complex signals into a combination of simpler or more fundamental ones, and,</li>
				<li>coming up with tools to easily manipulate and perform various operations on signals (e.g., to find the response generated by a system to a given signal).</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			It turns out that sinusoidal signals and complex exponential signals are the most convenient choices for "simple" signals, at least in the context of LTI systems (we will briefly discuss why in the sections that follow), and often we will find ourselves trying to decompose complex signals into linear combinations of such simpler signals, so that we can exploit the linearity and homogeneity properties of LTI systems.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			In this article, we will discuss transforms as techniques developed to analyze signals by decomposing them to simpler/more fundamental signals, and to perform various operations on them more easily. We will limit our discussion to continuous-time signals and discuss three types of commonly used transforms with such signals, namely, the Fourier Series, the Fourier Transform, and the Laplace Transform.
		</div>
		<h2>Fourier Series</h2>
		<div class="para">
			The Fourier Series of a periodic function is a decomposition of the function into a linear combination of complex exponentials of the form \(e^{j\omega t}\). Given a periodic, continuous-time signal \(x(t)\) with fundamental period \(T\) and angular frequency \(\omega_0=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}\), its Fourier Series is the infinite sum \[
				\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k\cdot e^{jk\omega_0t},
			\] where for each \(k\), \[
				a_k = \dfrac{1}{T}\int_T x(t)\cdot e^{-jk\omega_0t}\,dt.
			\]
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Let us first discuss why it may be "natural" to decompose a signal in this manner. We begin by looking back at Fourier’s original work.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Fourier was attempting to solve the problem of how the temperature distribution of a heated metal ring with a given initial distribution, evolves with time. The solutions to this problem are governed by the Heat Equation, a second-order, linear, partial differential equation, the solutions to which, in Fourier’s case, had to be periodic, and had to have particular frequencies due to the circular nature of the ring.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Now Fourier observed that sinusoidal functions with harmonically related frequencies were solutions to the problem, and by the linearity of the equation, that linear combinations of such sinusoids were also solutions. He therefore assumed a solution of a form similar to the first equation above (that consisted of sinusoids instead of complex exponentials), but was then faced with the problem of expressing the initial temperature distribution of the ring in the same form. It was at this point that he simply assumed that any arbitrary temperature distribution may be expressed as a sum of infinitely many harmonically related sinusoids, and it is this concept that developed into what we now know as a Fourier Series.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Many signals we see in nature are periodic. The simplest periodic waves that we see in nature are sinusoidal. Sinusoids are "nice", in that they are "smooth", continuous, and easy to integrate and differentiate, with their integrals and derivatives also being other sinusoids.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Hence, although not many periodic signals in nature are perfect sinusoids, it is in some sense "natural" to assume that they may be composed of a number of scaled sinusoidal signals added to each other; each one contributing a small oscillation to produce the original signal, just like Fourier thought.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Based on these facts, the existence of such a decomposition, and the convergence of the integrals involved are educated guesses we make; but guesses that we find to be true in a lot of cases, and when true, greatly simplify our work.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			To the mathematical mind, however, such "educated guesses" are not sufficient, and strict conditions for existence backed by proofs are required. But this is the business of analysis, and is out of the scope of this article, so we will leave it out. We will simply assume that the signals we are working with already satisfy these conditions.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Now as to why we chose signals of the form \(e^{j\omega t}\) above instead of sinusoids, it is simply because it generalizes the method to the other transforms that we will discuss in this article, and also enables us to find the Fourier Series for a larger class of signals. Notice that \(e^{j\omega t}\) does still represent sinusoids—\(e^{j\omega t} = \cos(\omega t) + j\sin(\omega t)\) from Euler’s Formula—we can simply think of it as more compact notation to represent sinusoids.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Now that we have a feel for why we may be interested in finding a Fourier Series, we turn to the problem of how.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			We start by making our educated assumption that some continuous-time signal \(x(t)\) has a representation of the form (1), so the problem boils down to finding the coefficients \(a_k\) such that we have the equality \[
				x(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k e^{jk\omega_0t}.
			\]
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			To find the \(K\)<sup>th</sup> coefficient \(a_K\), (\(K \in \mathbb{Z}\)), we multiply both sides of the above by \(e^{-jK\omega_0 t}\) and integrate as shown, to obtain
			\[
				\begin{align*}
					x(t)\cdot e^{-jK\omega_0 t}
					&=
					\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k e^{jk\omega_0t} \cdot e^{-jK\omega_0 t}\\
					&=
					\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k e^{j(k-K)\omega_0t}\\
					\int_T x(t)\cdot e^{-jK\omega_0 t}
					&=
					\int_T \left(
						\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k e^{j(k-K)\omega_0t}
					\right)\,dt\\
					&=
					\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k \int_T e^{j(k-K)\omega_0t}\, dt.
				\end{align*}
			\]
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Note that we freely performed manipulations such as moving integrals inside and outside summations in the work above without giving much thought to it. We emphasize that such manipulations are only justified when the functions involved satisfy certain conditions, and we assume that the functions we work with do indeed satisfy them. The assumption is reasonable enough, actually, because typical signals we encounter in real-life scenarios do satisfy them.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Returning to the problem, observe that when \(k\ne K\), we have \(\displaystyle\int_T e^{j(k-K)\omega_0t}\, dt=0\), because \(T\) is a period of the complex exponential with angular frequency \((k-K)\omega_0\), and the integral of a complex exponential over a period is \(0\). Only when \(k=K\) is this integral non-zero, in which case \(\displaystyle\int_T e^{j(K-K)\omega_0t}\, dt=\int_T1\,dt=T\). This means that there is only one non-zero term in the sum on the right hand side above, and it occurs when the index of summation \(k\) equals \(K\), so we can write
			\[
				\begin{align*}
					\int_T x(t)\cdot e^{-jK\omega_0 t}
					&=
					a_K\cdot T\\
					a_K
					&=
					\dfrac{1}{T}\int_T x(t)\cdot e^{-jK\omega_0 t}.
				\end{align*}
			\]
			We have just found the \(K\)<sup>th</sup> coefficient as we intended to.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			Observe how these coefficients act as "weights" that "scale" each complex exponential in (1). In this sense, they tell us how much "contribution" is given by each harmonic \(e^{jk\omega_0 t}\) to the final signal, i.e., to what "extent" the signal contains a frequency component of \(k\omega_0\).
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			We note further that these \(a_k\)'s in some sense represent our function in the frequency domain. To see this, we treat \(a_k\) as a discrete-time function of \(k\); \[
				a_k = a[k] = \dfrac{1}{T}\int_T x(t) e^{-jK\omega_0 t}.
			\]
			By putting in a certain value for \(k\), we find "how much" of the frequency component \(k\omega_0\) is present in the original signal.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			The natural question that now arises is whether the Fourier Series extends to aperiodic signals. This leads us to the Fourier Transform, which we now discuss.
